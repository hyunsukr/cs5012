### Notes for Students and Instructors
---

**Challenges**  
1. The most challenging thing for students has been the breadth of coverage in the time available.  
The course developers chose to cover a vast array of topics, some in detail.  
**Focusing your attention on the items in the Learning Outcomes will help on assessments.**  
Example: while many sort algorithms are discussed, Merge Sort is a focus.

2. Really understanding an algorithm means knowing how it works, why it works and how to code it. 
    Run the code in debug mode and step through it.
    
3. Many tasks with trees (measuring its depth) can be solved with recursion. It takes practice to use this effectively.

**Big Ideas**
- Data structures: how they work, pros & cons of each
- Algorithms: how they work, pros & cons of each (e.g., greedy, exhaustive, dynamic programming, ...)
- Concepts of Databases

**Cumulative Knowledge**  
Some topics, such as time complexity, come up repeatedly in the course. Make it your friend!

**In Class Activities (ICAs)**  
Live Sessions include 15-20 mins for ICAs where students work in small groups.  
They're fun and students really benefit and learn a lot from one another.

**Coding Prerequisites**  
Make sure you really understand implementing these items in Python:
- data types
- functions
- classes

Make sure you understand how recursion works. This comes up often, particularly with tree structures.

**Academic Honesty**  
Each student writes their own code in assignments.
