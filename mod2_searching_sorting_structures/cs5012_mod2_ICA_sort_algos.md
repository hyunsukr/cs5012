#### 2.3 ICA: Group Sorting Algorithm Setup  

**Directions:**  
This week, we explored Merge Sort, a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.  
Now it’s your turn to explore some of the other sorting algorithms.  
At this week’s live session, you will get into groups of 3-4, and each group will be responsible for one of the four algorithms:

- Bubble Sort (Group 1, 5, ...)
- Quick Sort (Group 2, 6, ...)
- Radix Sort (Group 3, 7, ...)
- Shell Sort (Group 4, 8, ...)

The Task: Put together a short ( 8–10 minute) presentation file for your assigned algorithm and include the following: 

1. General description of the algorithm 
2. Demonstration: How it works (review code/algorithm) 
3. Advantages 
4. Disadvantages  
   - Can you think of ways to remedy any of these disadvantages?
5. State the Complexity (in the worst case—that is Big-Oh!) and briefly explain why it has that complexity
6. Would you recommend this algorithm? Why or why not? 
   - Scenario in which you’d use this algorithm

Use the videos and slides provided earlier in this module to assist in this activity.  
Elect one member in your group to submit your file as powerpoint or pdf.  
Include on slide 1:
- all team member names
- algorithm name
