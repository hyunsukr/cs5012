### Q & A

---  
### Review M2.2 Course Content 

**Searching**  
- Searching algos deck, starting on p5  
Binary search - complexity O(log n)  

**Sorting**  
- Sorting algos deck, starting on slide 3  
Briefly discuss *sorting stability*  
Many different algos and approaches presented  
sorting is often a first step to search (binary search)  

**Merge sort**  
- Divide-and-conquer algo; Sorting algos deck, starting p41; diagram p49  
one of the most efficient sorting algorithms  
good time complexity in worst and average cases: O(n log n)  
pay close attention to this algo

Not necessary to memorize how each of the sorting algos work.  
Develop an understanding how to measure time complexity for the different search, sort algorithms.

**Contiguous (Array) vs Non-contiguous (Chain) data structures**

**Array**  
size: specified in advance  
data accessed: directly by using pointer arithmetic

**Chain**  
size: not specified in advance  
data accessed: only by traversing the list

Python lists are implemented as [dynamic arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array)
