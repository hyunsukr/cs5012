  - content questions
  - ask me anything about data science

### Q & A

---  
### Review M8.2 Course Content 

- **Max throughput thru network**  

> Demo Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for determining max flow on network
source: https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/maximum-flow/tutorial/

Important concepts:
- residual graph captures additional flow possible
- forward edge
- backward edge
- augmenting path

**Reductions**
> Walk through Reductions deck, explaning:
- Solving Maximum Bipartite Matching using Max Flow  
Interestingly and perhaps not obvious at first, we can use Max Flow to solve this matching problem.  
This is an example of a reduction (use known solution to solve analogous problem)
