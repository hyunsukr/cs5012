### Q & A

---  
### Review M6.2 Course Content 

- Important Topics:
  - **Divide and Conquer** - solve a problem by: 
   1) divide problem into smaller subproblems 
   2) solving the subproblems
   3) combining the subproblem solutions

  - **Brute Force (Exhaustive) Search**
  - **Heuristics**

  - **Greedy methods**  
    makes locally optimal choices; global optimum not guaranteed  
    solves a problem by: 
   1) divide problem into smaller subproblems 
   2) choose best (greedy) solution to each subproblem.
      
  - **Best-first search (greedy search)**
  - A* search  
   widely used in path finding and graph traversal

**We will review:**
> Greedy Algorithms deck; start at slide 16
- Best-first Search
- A* Search

> Greedy Algorithm Design deck
- change making
- interval scheduling

> walk through `greedy_change_maker.py`
