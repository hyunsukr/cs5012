### Review M7.2 Course Content 

- **Introduction to Dynamic Programming (DP)**  

Useful when there is:
- optimal substructure
- overlapping subproblems

Typically apply DP to optimization problems

DP applies time-memory tradeoff: store solns to subproblems to avoid recompute

**Examples:**

- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**

- **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**

**Compare DP vs Greedy vs Divide and Conquer**

> Review Dynamic Programming deck. LCS starts on s17. Walk thru s28. Fill in LCS table.  

> Review Edit Distance deck. starting slide 17. Explain how to fill in table.

Note the recursive substructure in both methods.
