#### Course Objectives

In this course students gain a better understanding of the underpinnings of the Data Science tools they use from the perspective of a computer scientist.  Students will learn to leverage this understanding to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their code and analytical tools.  

The purpose of this class is to introduce to you the main CS concepts that you will learn in more detail in the remaining Data Science Master’s program.  Due to introducing a variety of concepts, the tradeoff is that there is not enough time to cover them in great detail.  A deeper understanding of these concepts will come during subsequent DS courses and while you engage with practicing on your own.  As a graduate level course, CS5012 depends a lot on self-regulated learning and further exploration (and practice) of the concepts introduced in this class, at your own time.

#### Course Topic Details
The topics covered in this course include the following, presented in the approximate order in which they will be taught.  
This list of topics is to be considered a reference that can be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs.

    • Discrete Structures*
    • Computational Complexity
    • Basic Data Structures and Algorithms
    • Hash Tables
    • Trees and Graphs
    • Balanced Trees
    • Advanced Algorithms I
    • Advanced Algorithms II
    • Time Complexity Hierarchy
    • Classic CS Problems and Reductions
    • Regular Expressions
    • Introduction to Databases

*Note: This course will assume you are knowledgeable about Functions, Relations, Sets, and Logic.  
Material will be provided for review (Module 0), or for you to learn on your own.  
This material IS testable material!

#### Course Outcomes
It is expected, at the completion of this course, students will be able to:

    I. Select, Computationally Assess, and Deploy appropriate and efficient data structures and algorithms to solve Data Science problems
    II. Define and Use Logic, Data Structures, and Algorithms to Solve Problems
    III. Connect, Transform, and Reduce Real-World Problems to Classical Problem Frameworks to make use of existing, efficient algorithmic solutions.
    IV. Independently Explore advanced or supplementary topics to attain a deeper and complimentary understanding of topics.
    V. Reflect on peer-feedback, instructor-feedback, experiences, and lessons-learned related to the use of data structures and algorithms to make continual improvements and updates to methodologies applied
    VI. Have a working knowledge of the Algorithm Complexity Class Hierarchy in order to gain perspective of the scope of the field and its contextual application to Data Science
    VII. Design and understand regular expressions for pattern matching
    VIII. Understand the important considerations for proper database design

**Quizzes**  
- **Quizzes are closed book**

**Homework assignments**  
- Should be your own work. You may collaborate on ideas.  
- Late Homework Assignments: 10% of the total grade will be deducted per day, where the day means 11:59 p.m. cutoff. After five days late, it will be marked as 0 points.
- **MAKE SURE TO SUBMIT THE CORRECT FILE. Incorrect files are subject to the Late HW Policy.**

**In-class Activities (ICA)**  
- In-class activities aim to enhance your understanding of presented concepts while working in groups, so it’s important to attend the live session each week; ICAs will be completed in Zoom breakout rooms.
- ICAs will not be collected after the due date.
- **MAKE SURE TO SUBMIT THE CORRECT FILE**

**Exams**  
- **Exams are closed book**

#### Preparing for Live Session

- It is recommended that you review the Module ICA in advance
- It will also be helpful to review Module Course Content in advance

#### Class Management

**General**  

- Please feel free to join the office hours (with me and TA’s) to discuss any issues. Also, we can arrange a mutually agreeable time outside of the office hours.
- Email is the best way to get in touch with the instructor. Please include “CS 5012” in the subject line of your email.
- Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any problems, concerns, questions, or issues regarding the course, material, or anything else in the class.
- Please do not hesitate to talk to me if there are situations in your life that are affecting your performance in the class or your life here at UVa. I might not be able to help, but I might know of resources that might help.

**Creating a Positive Class Environment**  

Your success in this class depends on others! These are your classmates, your instructor, and the teaching assistants. Learning is a fundamentally social process and learning communities thrive when they value what every individual has to share. You each bring in knowledge and experiences about how to create a positive course environment, which you might need to challenge or build upon to help you succeed in this course. We will work together to create an environment where each person is valued as an individual, and where you can learn and contribute with your full potential, whatever your sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, disability status and other aspects of your identity. Creating a positive environment is a learning process, because social and cultural norms influence our behavior in ways we are or aren’t aware of (positive or negative), so we are all going to make mistakes in how we treat others. I am working on learning how to respond appropriately and promptly when I make or witness such mistakes. When I personally make mistakes or miss an opportunity to respond, please let me know privately either in person (visiting office hours) or by email. You should always remember that our cultural or other difference should act as a strength, and not a hurdle, to how we work and communicate with each other. This is a learning opportunity to everyone and I will be grateful for your constructive feedback, which helps me learn and improve.

#### This Syllabus

This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs. 
This syllabus can be changed at any time without notification. It is up to the student to monitor this page for any changes. 
Final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.

#### Academic Integrity

The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future.
Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud (http://www.student.virginia.edu/ honor/proc/fraud.html). Each assignment will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be considered Honor violations. If you have questions on what is allowable, ask! Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual assignments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam to a student who has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Sending, receiving or otherwise copying electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions).
Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee
if that is appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to work with partners on remaining homework assignments.

#### SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
If you have been identified as a Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) student, please let the Center know you are taking this class. If you suspect you should be an SDAC student, please schedule an appointment with them for an evaluation. The recommended accommodations will be provided for those students identified by the SDAC. Please contact your instructor one week before an exam so we can make accommodations.

If you are affected by a situation that falls within issues addressed by the SDAC and the instructor and staff are not informed about this in advance, this prevents us from helping during the semester, and it is unfair to request special considerations at the end of the term or after work is completed. So we request you inform the instructor as early in the term as possible your circumstances. If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.) please contact your instructor and/or TA as soon as you know these may affect you in class.
